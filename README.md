# k_minimal_anonymity

This is the programming assignment of COMP 3632.

The goal of anonymize.py is to anonaymize a sensitive dataset (e.g. datafile) into a minimal k-anonymity set.
##### minimality
We define minimality as the smallest change (the total difference between anonymize identifers and original identifiers) in all possible k-anonymity sets.
Can be achieved through dynamic programming. 
##### datafile
Datafile consists of two columns: Age and Phage (with 0 denoting not having the disease and 1 otherwise)
##### datafile_out
sample output.
